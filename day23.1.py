#Conclusion
# This code uses the matplotlib library to create a line chart illustrating daily temperature variations over a month.
# It defines lists for the days and corresponding temperature values.
# The chart is configured with a 12x6 inch figure size, plotting the temperature data with blue lines and circle markers.
# Axis labels and a title are added to enhance clarity, with the x-axis labels rotated for better readability.
# A grid with dashed lines is included to improve visual separation.
# The resulting chart clearly depicts the temperature trends across the days, making it easy to interpret the data.
